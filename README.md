# Multilevel Aging Cache

## Overview
This library aims to provide an interface for storing and retrieving data from a hierarchy of 
commonly used persistence mechanisms. In a storage hierarchy, different storage systems are faster
than others. Specify a hierarchy and allow the system to manage reading/writing to each layer.

## Usage
See the [demo program](https://github.com/LinkedMink/multilevel-aging-cache/blob/master/demo/CliSampleApp.ts) 
for an example of how to use the library.
